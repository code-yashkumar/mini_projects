# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

A modern **Rock Paper Scissors** game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, featuring a custom-designed UI, round selection, real-time score tracking, and game-over overlays.

This project was created as a learning-focused mini project to strengthen **JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and UI-to-code conversion**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – Custom styling, gradients, layout  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Game logic & state handling  
- **Figma** – UI design & layout planning  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Managing game state using a single `gameState` object
- Using **data attributes** (`data-move`, `data-rounds`) for clean JS logic
- Structuring JavaScript in a readable, scalable way
- Separating UI logic from game logic
- Debugging CSS/JS conflicts and refactoring code
- Converting a Figma design into real HTML & CSS
