# Tic Tac Toe (JavaScript)

A simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
This project focuses on DOM manipulation, game logic, and basic UI state handling.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay (Player X vs Player O)
- Win detection using predefined winning combinations
- Draw detection when all cells are filled
- Reset game functionality
- Clean and responsive UI
- CSS variables for easy theming
- Dark mode support using CSS variables

## How It Works

- Players take turns clicking on the grid cells
- Each click places either **X** or **O**
- The game checks for a winning pattern after every move
- If all 9 moves are played without a winner, the game declares a draw
- The **Reset Game** button clears the board and restarts the game

## Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS (CSS variables, grid layout)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling)

## Learning Outcomes

- Working with DOM events
- Managing game state using JavaScript
- Implementing win and draw logic
- Using CSS variables for theming
- Structuring a small frontend project
