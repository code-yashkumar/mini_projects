# Mini Projects (JavaScript)

This repository contains a collection of small JavaScript projects built
to practice core frontend concepts such as logic building, DOM manipulation,
and basic UI interactions.

The goal of this repository is consistent learning through hands-on
projects rather than polished production apps.

## Projects

- **Calculator**  
  A simple calculator supporting basic arithmetic operations.

- **Tic Tac Toe**  
  A two-player Tic Tac Toe game built using JavaScript and DOM logic.

- **Rock Paper Scissors**  
  A classic Rock Paper Scissors game implemented using JavaScript.

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes a brief README
describing its features and implementation.
